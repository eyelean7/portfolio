            <p>I was born in the suburbs of Chicago in 1991. I have 2 brothers and 2 sisters. My family's heritage is that of Poland, Germany, Norway, Russia.<br>My family is very musical. I play the oboe, and several other instruments. My sister is a piano and singing teacher. Both of my brothers play the piano. My younger sister is a magnificent singer.<br>Sometimes I write poetry. Sometimes I write code. They are, more or less, the same.</p>

            <p>In 2013, I graduated with a Bachelor's of Music Education from Illinois Wesleyan University. I got my first teaching job later that year as a middle-school band director in a small town called Sterling, IL. That was the year I started teaching myself to code. I started with <strong>SQL</strong>.<br>The next year I moved to Seattle, WA. I continued learning to code in my spare time, this time delving into <strong>Python</strong>. I continued working as a teacher until March of 2017, when I enrolled in Epicodus's full-time web development program.</p>
