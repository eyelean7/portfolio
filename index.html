            <h3>Animal Shelter</h3>
          </a>
          <p>This project uses HTML and CSS to create a well-formatted website for animals who need a home.</p>

            <h3>Octopus</h3>
          </a>
          <p>We think the octopus is cool. Our git init maybe happened in a weird place, which is why I linked to a section of the repository rather than the entire thing. HTML for content and CSS for styling</p>

            <h3>Wikipedia</h3>
          </a>
          <p>Our wikipedia imitation page <em>almost</em> looks like the real deal! Okay... maybe not. But check out those sweet nav-bars! This site was created with bootstrap, and of course HTML and CSS.</p>

  <!-- An “About Me” section -->
      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am from Chicago. I like penguins. I play the oboe. Sometimes I write poetry. Sometimes I write code. Aren't they more or less the same?</p>
  <!-- Your background (education, job experience, or why did you decide to take a class on programming, etc). -->
      <p>In 2013, I graduated with a Bachelor's of Music Education from Illinois Wesleyan University. Since then I have spent time as a early childhood educator, a private music instructor, and a classroom teacher. I hope that in learning to code I can create tools to help teachers, students, and parents.</p>
